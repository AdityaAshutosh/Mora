- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Utilizes several advanced visual AI agents, each specializing in different aspects of the video generation process, to achieve high-quality outcomes across various tasks.
- **Broad Spectrum of Tasks**: Capable of performing text-to-video generation, text-conditional image-to-video generation, extending generated videos, video-to-video editing, connecting videos, and simulating digital worlds, thereby covering an extensive range of video generation applications.
- **Open-Source and Extendable**: Mora‚Äôs open-source nature fosters innovation and collaboration within the community, allowing for continuous improvement and customization.
- **Proven Performance**: Experimental results demonstrate Mora's ability to achieve performance that is close to that of Sora in various tasks, making it a compelling open-source alternative for the video generation domain.
